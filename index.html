                The main task of an underground LHD loader is to move material from a blasted face to a crusher, orepass or truck. 
                To fully automate the operation of an LHD loader, the loader must be able to detect the muck pile during its bucket 
                filling operation. As the dusty and poorly lit underground environment poses a serious challenge, automating muck pile 
                detection is one of the main obstacles towards fully automated operation. Your task is to build a solution using LIDAR, 
                RGB-Cameras, Computer Vision and Machine Learning to detect the muck pile in order to automate the bucket filling operation of an LHD loader. 
                You will be provided with all the necessary sensor modules, Nvidia GPU hardware to train neural nets and pre-labeled data. 
                Join the Institute for Advanced Mining Technologies in its quest to solve LHD loader automation and help make underground 
                mining more safe and environmentally friendly. People from any background and creative solutions welcome!

               Whether sand, peas, coins or iron ore: in many areas of our lives, the quality is determined by the particle size distribution (PGV). 
                The PGV is classically determined by sieving, but can also be determined with high precision using pneumatic or special electronic methods.
                The determination of a PGV is therefore not possible ad hoc, but always requires a time-consuming effort. 
                Through random measurements on different materials, the PGV is to be estimated within the framework of the hackathon using optical methods (images).
                These can be used to monitor, control or regulate production plants.

                In the Geomonitoring Challenge, algorithms are to be developed to automatically detect trends and anomalies from known time series of measurement data and to predict a future course of measurement values.
                The current monitoring methods are limited to predefined absolute threshold values, which do not allow for an analysis of the measured value course and thus no automated early warning.
                The analysis could be performed using analytical, statistical methods and/or neural networks. The reference data could be used to train a neural network or to analyse history patterns.
                The expected result is a script that reads in monitoring data and outputs a predicted measurement history for the next 2 weeks.
                Time series parameters can be calculated to detect critical changes in the measured value course and to enable an extended view of the course.

                For improved ease of maintenance and process monitoring of decanter centrifuges, measurement data should be collected from the rotating system and transmitted to an evaluation unit outside the rotor. 
                Possible signals are wear progress, oil quality or forces. The amount of data to be transmitted is small and the transmission interval can be 1x per day or 1x per shift. 
                A concept for the transmission of information from the rotating steel body to a receiving unit on the static frame of the machine is to be developed.

	        In order to reduce the wear of elements for accelerating the separation process in centrifuges, a wear-resistant material is to be found for 3D printed components. 
            Previously used materials such as ceramics lead to cracking and fracture of the component due to their brittleness. 
                The use of materials, manufacturing processes and geometries that have sufficient toughness and high wear resistance should bring an improvement. 
                3D printing technology offers the possibility of producing a streamlined geometry from a hard material. 
                One possible solution is to make the geometry thicker in wear zones than in the support structure. The result should achieve a longer service life and cost efficiency.

                   Today's globally active technology Group <a target="_blank" href="">ANDRITZ</a> developed from a small iron foundry founded in 1852 by Hungarian entrepreneur Josef Körösi in the Graz suburb of Andritz.

With its approximately 1,200 highly qualified employees, ANDRITZ in Graz supplies all business areas with technologies and services. 
                    In close coordination with customers, new technologies are advanced and continuously developed in our R&D facilities and pilot plants.

In the local workshop, components for approximately 90 different products for the Hydro, Pulp & Paper, Separation, and Metals business areas are manufactured on a production area of 95,000 m2. 
                    In addition, repairs, conversions and assemblies are carried out on site. ANDRITZ trains young skilled workers in its in-house apprentice workshop.

ANDRITZ contributes significantly to local economic value creation and is of utmost importance for the local business location by creating or securing regional jobs within the company itself and indirectly through its cooperation with countless local suppliers.  

The company is strongly networked with research institutions and is a member of industrial and environmental clusters. 
                    For example, ANDRITZ recently joined the Green Tech Cluster, thus strengthening Styria as a hotspot for innovative energy and environmental technology. 
                    ANDRITZ wants to push digital initiatives and cooperation with young companies in the cluster.

                    The challenging environmental conditions in mines place particularly high demands on people, machines, sensors and algorithms and require robust,
